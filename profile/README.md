## About Yield Studio

At [Yield Studio](https://yieldstudio.fr), we help companies become more productive and identify levers for growth.

Tired of working on projects with no real impact, it was in 2019 that James and Cyrille created Yield Studio. 
Their goal ? Use tech to create innovations that bring value to the end-user and the business.

Our business: design and develop web & mobile applications.

The keys to our success :

- We identify killer features for end-users through an approach based on both Discovery and Delivery.
- We write high quality code from the start, so that we can go faster afterwards, thanks to our in-house and senior experts.
- We don't waste time on low value-added tasks, thanks to our in-house Lab, which provides our experts with powerful tools.
- A partnership more than a service... People first ðŸ’™
