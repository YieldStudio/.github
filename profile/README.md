## About Yield Studio

[Yield Studio](https://yieldstudio.fr) is specialised in application design and development. We accompany startups from their MVP to their scale-up phase.

Our mission is to take the code out of mere technical execution and add a coaching and consulting dimension to it, making it a business accelerator.

We love open source and want to contribute more and more.

To date we have developed or maintain a few libraries including:

- [🔑 Laravel UUID](https://github.com/YieldStudio/laravel-uuid): Eloquent UUID Trait
- [🔕 Symfony Fake SMS Notifier](https://github.com/YieldStudio/symfony-fake-sms-notifier): Provides fake SMS (as email during development) integration for Symfony Notifier.
